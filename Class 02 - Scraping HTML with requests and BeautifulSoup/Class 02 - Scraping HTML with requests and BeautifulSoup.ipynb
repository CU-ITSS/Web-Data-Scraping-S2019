    "[The Numbers](http://www.the-numbers.com) is a popular source of data about movies' box office revenue numbers. Their daily domestic charts are HTML tables with the top-grossing movies for each day of the year, going back for several years. This [table](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/daily/2018/12/25) for Christmas day in 2018 has coluns for the current week's ranking, previous week's ranking, name of movie, distributor, gross, change over the previous week, number of theaters, revenue per theater, total gross, and number of days since release. This looks like a fairly straightforward table that could be read directly into data frame-like structure.\n",

    "Finally, you can point `read_html` at a URL without any `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` and get all the tables on the page as a list of DataFrames. `pandas` is simply doing the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` on the inside. Interestingly, I'm getting a [HTTP 403](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403) error indicating the server (The Numbers) is forbidding the client (us) from accessing their data using this strategy. We will discuss next week whether and how to handle situations where web servers refuse connections from non-human clients. In this case, you cannot use the off-the-shelf `read_html` approach and would need to revert to using the `requests`+`BeautifulSoup` approach above."

In the case of the Oscars, the URLs appear to be consistently formatted: `https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2019` suggests that we could change the 2019 to any other date going back to the start of the Oscars and get that year as well: `https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2018` should get us the page for 2018, and so on. Let's demonstrate each of these strategies with the Oscars data: iterating from 2019 back to 1929 in the URL versus parsing the list of links from the header.\n",
